# Denox

## What is Denox?

Denox is a native GUI for administring your domains by integrating the [Domeneshop API](https://api.domeneshop.no). Denox simplifies the data from Domeneshop, and easily visualizes it and simplifies administration of your domains.


## How does Denox work?

By creating a profile in Denox, you store your API tokens and secrets locally on your machine. Your credentials never leave your computer except for when calling the API, meaning it never goes anywhere else than between your machine and the API itself.
